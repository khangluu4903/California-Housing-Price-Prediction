In this project, I did the following: 
- Utilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and exploration.
- Conducted data exploration and transformation, including log transformations of skewed variables to achieve a normal distribution.
- Employed scikit-learn for splitting the data into training and testing sets, as well as for fitting the linear multiple regression model.
- Utilized statsmodels for additional statistical analysis, including checking coefficients, p-values, and model summary statistics.
- Achieved R-squared value of 0.686, indicating th3 model explains about 68.6% of the variation in housing prices.
