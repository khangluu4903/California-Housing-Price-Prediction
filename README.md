In this project:
I Built a multiple linear regression model to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing Data set.
I Conducted data exploration and transformation, including log transformations of skewed variables.
I Evaluated the model, achieving an R-squared value of 0.686, indicating that the model explains about 68.6% of the variation in housing prices
